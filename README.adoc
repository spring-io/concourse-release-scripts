= Concourse Release Scripts

A Spring Boot application for distributing build artifacts to public repositories.


== Overview

The Concourse Release Scripts application can be included in Concourse container build images to distribute build artifacts to public repositories.

This is a command line application and it should be used as such in build scripts.
To configure the app, add an `application.yml` file in the same folder or in `./config`.
For more on that, see the https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/spring-boot-features.html#boot-features-external-config-application-property-files[Spring Boot reference documentation]. The available configuration options are described in the <<Configuration Properties>> section.

.Launching the application on the CLI
----
java -jar ./concourse-release-scripts.jar $COMMAND [$ARG...]
----

To interact with Artifactory repositories in Concourse, usage of the https://github.com/spring-io/artifactory-resource[Concourse Artifactory Resource] is recommended.

== Configuration Properties

This application interacts with Artifactory and Maven Central.
The corresponding credentials must be provided using configuration properties:

[source,yml,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
.Artifactory Configuration Properties
----
artifactory:
  username: # Artifactory credentials, username
  password: # Artifactory credentials, password
  # server property is currently locked on https://repo.spring.io
----

[source,yml,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
.Sonatype Configuration Properties
----
sonatype:
  username: # Sonatype user name.
  password: # Sonatype password.
  url: # URL of the Nexus instance used to publish releases.
  staging_profile: # Name of the staging profile used to publish releases. Usually the top-level group id, e.g. "org.springframework"
  staging_profile_id: # ID of the staging profile used to publish releases. Deprecated, use staging_profile instead

.SDKMAN! Configuration Properties
----
sdkman:
  consumer-key: # SDKMAN! Consumer Key
  consumer-token: # SDKMAN! Consumer Token
  candidate: # SDKMAN! candidate name
  artifact: # group:artifact:version[:packaging[:classifier]] coordinates with version ignored, e.g. "org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-cli:*:zip:bin"

== Commands

The Concourse Release Scripts application supports several commands:

* `publishToCentral`, to publish artifacts to Maven Central.
* `promote`, to move the build artifacts to a target repository in Artifactory.
* `publishToSdkMan`, to publish the Spring Boot CLI to SDKMAN!.


[source,sh,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
.Command example
----
java -jar /concourse-release-scripts.jar $COMMAND $RELEASE_TYPE $BUILD_INFO_LOCATION
----

Where:

* `$COMMAND` is the command name: `promote`, `distribute`, `publishGradlePlugin` or `syncToMavenCentral`
* `$RELEASE_TYPE` is the type of release: `"M"` (milestones), `"RC"` (release candidates) or `"RELEASE"`
* `$BUILD_INFO_LOCATION` should point to the absolute location of the artifactory build file info (e.g. `/local-repository/build-info.json`)


=== Publish To Maven Central Command

Command used to publish artifacts to Maven Central using the OSS Sonatype instance.
The release is published by creating a staging repository and deploying to it the artifacts at the given `$ARTIFACTS_LOCATION`.
The repository is then closed and, upon successful closure, it is released.

[source,sh,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
.Command example
----
java -jar /concourse-release-scripts.jar publishToCentral $RELEASE_TYPE $BUILD_INFO_LOCATION $ARTIFACTS_LOCATION
----

Where:

* `$RELEASE_TYPE` is the type of release: `"M"` (milestones), `"RC"` (release candidates) or `"RELEASE"`
* `$BUILD_INFO_LOCATION` should point to the absolute location of the artifactory build file info (e.g. `/local-repository/build-info.json`)
* `$ARTIFACTS_LOCATION` the location of the local artifact repository (e.g. `local-repository`)

There are additional configuration properties available for tuning the publishing process:

[source,yml,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
.Sonatype Configuration Properties
----
sonatype:
  polling_interval: 15s # Time between requests made to determine if the closing of a staging repository has completed.
  upload_threads: 8 # Number of threads used to upload artifacts to the staging repository.
  exclude: # Regular expression patterns of artifacts to exclude
    - 'build-info\.json' # required to avoid publishing Artifactory build info
    - 'org/springframework/boot/spring-boot-docs/.*'
----


=== Promote command

Command used to move the build artifacts to a target repository in Artifactory.
This steps usually happens after the staging of artifacts on Artifactory.
This step can be done with the https://github.com/spring-io/artifactory-resource[Concourse Artifactory Resource].

This command sends a request to the Artifactory REST API to promote artifacts from a staging repository to a target repository.


=== Publish an artifact to SDKMAN!

[source,sh,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
.Command example
----
java -jar /concourse-release-scripts.jar publishToSdkman $RELEASE_TYPE $VERSION $BRANCH
----

Where:

* `$RELEASE_TYPE` is the type of release: `"M"` (milestones), `"RC"` (release candidates) or `"RELEASE"`
* `$VERSION` the actual artifact version
* `$BRANCH` the git branch the artifact is being tagged and released from
